		Dear all,	
		</p>
		<p>
		Welcome to, what is the final and finished version of my continous development program - The Election Software for Army Public School, Chennai. Five years in the making, from a simple software with a basic interface has finally become a website that can work across all screens and devices.
		</p>
		<p>
		As an avid programmer and hardcore computer nerd, this will always be my first programming "contract". I still remember asking my Principal about conducting the elction electronically through the computer. The pretext of saving paper was a convincing cover story for my enthusiasm to test my programming skills. From then on, it was a project that I constantly focused on; learning new skills and techniques and infusing them into the project to make it better. My constant experimentation and dabbling in the latest of computer science would have all been for naught without this oppurtunity to express my creativity ( or should I say crazy ideas ).
		</p>
		<p>
		To all my teachers who supported me in this journey of the student council, I cannot express my gratitude and thanks for all the supporr and smiles I recieved along the way. As my technical guru, Armugam Sir showed me the technical road of 0s and 1s while Sridevi Ma'am was the constant challenger, making the election program more advanced and better with constant upgrades.Finally, my tutor through 11th and 12th and more notably , the Sir who allowed me to tutor the rest of my class was Basha Sir. His guidance and oppurtunity to teach and to motivate me with his kind words were a constant support, epecially through my board exams. Finally, I remember my election days through the years, where all election official teachers joined hands to make the voting proceed smoothly and helped the students exercise their right to vote. 
		</p>
		<p>
		While my fellow friends and notably juniors did complain that electronic voting made things go much faster and lost time to bunk classes, I'm glad that this never dented their enthusiasm to participate in the competition. Not only did they constantly support and update my progress, they ensured that my procrastination didn't leave the project undone. To all my friends; seniors, classmates and juniors alike, I express my teary eyed thanks. My memories are filled with our days together and no words can describe the fun we had.
		</p>
		<p>
		As a former Head Boy myself, I still stand by my words; I felt no pressure wearing the badge. If you believe in the trust placed in you and treat that trust and responsibility with fairness and hard work, the badge become an honour rather than a chore. My only regret rather was never being able to recite the pledge in Hindi; something I'm sure will leave an embarrasing smile on my face.
		</p>
		<p>
		To all those who participate for the honour and glory in the race to lead the school to dazzling new heights yet to be reached, I wish them best of luck. May the best win !!
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally, to my beloved Principal, Mrs.Uma Chandrasekar. Ma'am, hadn't you said yes the day I asked, this whole journey wouldn't have taken any step forward.

		This website was created with a 7 year old computer and all the knowledge required to make this happen was learnt from the internet through various free to learn courses and encyclopedia. I hope this is proof enough that you don't need expensive Apple computers or special training to build your code. And in the spirit of Coding Adventure, I challenge you to go find your own ways to learn the programming paradigm ( Oh and all copy rights of this website are owned by me, Jacob Mathew, developer and maintenance )&copy &#8482 &reg
